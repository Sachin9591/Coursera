# Data Science Methodology

### Final Assignment:   
In this Assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of the data science methodology by applying it to a given problem. Pick one of the following topics to apply the data science methodology to:

- Emails
- Hospitals
- Credit Cards

You will have to play the role of the client as well as the data scientist to come up with a problem that is more specific but related to these topics.

##### Project Title:    
Data Science Methodology Final Assess

##### Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to?   
My Answer: I have chosen Credit Cards topic to apply the data science methodology. 

##### Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer.

You are required to:

- Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
- Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.

My Answer: The main problem of maintaining the credit card holders in the Bank Servers. The Bank has to check the records of the Credit Card holders, so to avoid the payment issues, need to create a model of type of credit card features is used based on their financial needs.
So the question for this model would be: "Can we predict the payment is made by default or not?"


##### Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with.:

- Analytic Approach
- Data Requirements
- Data Collection
- Data Understanding and Preparation
- Modeling and Evaluation

My Answer:    
1. Analytic Approach: The problem require YES/No answer to create classification model. 

2. Data Requirements: Creation of a classification model needs bank clients. The features include clients personal information of credit card, bill statements of past 3 months, payment transactions of past 3 months.   

3. Data Collection: Using descriptive statistics and data evaluation techniques, we can have the correct information for predictive model.

4. Data Understanding and Preparation: We need different variables of our data to understand much more. We can use univariate statistics and correlation between variables. So we need to evaluate the quality of data. Data Preparation took almost 90% time of the whole project, we look for missing of data, visualization features and transformation of data to create a better fit of the model.

5. Modeling and Evaluation: Finally we create a classification model and evaluate the outcome result. And we may need to make some changes to get a suitable model.
